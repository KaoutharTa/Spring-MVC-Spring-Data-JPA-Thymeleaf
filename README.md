<h1>Hospital Management System Project Report</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This report outlines the features and functionalities of the Hospital Management System, a web-based application designed to facilitate the management of patient data within a hospital. This system allows for efficient handling of patient records, including creation, modification, searching, and deletion of patient information. The system is built to enhance the administrative capabilities of hospital staff and improve the efficiency of patient data management.</p>

  <h2>System Overview</h2>
    <p>The system is structured into several key components, each designed to handle specific aspects of hospital management:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Includes the <code>Patient</code> class that models the patient data.</li>
        <li><strong>Repositories:</strong> Manages data operations and communicates with the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Web:</strong> Handles HTTP requests and responses. Key components include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>PatientController</code>: Manages web requests related to patients.</li>
            <li><code>HospitalApplication</code>: The Spring Boot application class that configures the overall application.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Resources/Templates:</strong> Contains HTML files for the user interface, including:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>editPatient.html</code>: For editing patient details.</li>
            <li><code>formPatients.html</code>: For adding new patients.</li>
            <li><code>patients.html</code>: For listing and searching patients.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>Adding Patients</h3>
    <p>Users can add new patients to the system by filling out a form that validates input to ensure data integrity. For example, the name must not be empty and must be between 4 and 20 characters, and the score must be at least 100.</p>

  <h3>Editing and Deleting Patients</h3>
    <p>Patients' details can be edited through a dedicated form. A confirmation alert is implemented for deletions to prevent accidental data loss, enhancing data management safety.</p>

  <h3>Searching for Patients</h3>
    <p>The system provides a robust search functionality that allows users to find patients by name, score, or other keywords, facilitating quick access to patient records.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Hospital Management System is designed to streamline the management of patient data in hospital settings. The application's robust functionality coupled with user-friendly interfaces ensures efficient and effective hospital administration and data management. Future enhancements could include advanced reporting features, integration with other hospital systems, and improved data security measures.</p>
